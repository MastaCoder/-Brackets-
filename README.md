## Features
[Brackets] is a tournament management software which allows users to join, participate in, and organize tournaments.

## Usage
### Setup
[Brackets] is a React app. Hence, you will need `npm` installed locally to run the React development server. To start it:
```
git clone https://github.com/csc309-fall-2021/team05.git
cd team05/frontend
npm install         # Install all dependencies locally
npm start           # Start dev server
```
At this point, the dev server should automatically redirect you to the localhost URL. By default, this is http://localhost:3000/

### Login
Currently, login is supported for two users. They are
* Username `user`, password `user` for a generic user account.
* Username `admin`, password `admin` for a generic admin account.

## Third-party Libraries
[Brackets] uses the following third-party libraries:
1. React
2. Material UI
